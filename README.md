#Seminar on programming techniques

We are delighted to see that so many of you use or plan to use Python. To help you with the first steps, we propose to organise a seminar once every two weeks, which will cover:

* basics of Python,
* some popular Python libraries for data analysis and plotting,
* techniques that we find indispensable in the daily research work (testing, code sharing, collaborative programming).

Although the course will be Python-centered, many of the techniques we will cover can be applied in other programming languages (like Elphy or Matlab).
